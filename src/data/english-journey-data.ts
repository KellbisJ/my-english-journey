			'## General Truths in English\n\n### What They Are?\n\nGeneral truths are statements or facts that are usually true for most people or situations. These are things that have been consistently observed or tested and apply broadly across different contexts.\n\n### How to Use Them?\n\nYou can express general truths using the modal verb "can" to indicate that something is typically true.\n\n### Examples of General Truths\n\nHere’s a scenario: What happens if you go outside when it’s raining without an umbrella or a jacket?\n\nOf course, you\'re going to get wet. This illustrates a general truth because it is something that happens to everyone in similar situations.\n\n### "Can" for Things That Are Usually True\n\n- Taking a shower before going to bed can help you sleep better.\n- Caffeine can increase blood pressure.\n- You can get sick if you go out without a jacket during winter.\n- It can be dangerous to do that.\n- Drinking water regularly can keep you hydrated.\n- Exercising regularly can improve your overall health.\n- Reading books can expand your knowledge.\n- Eating too much sugar can lead to health problems.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how general truths are universally applicable and can be easily understood by most people.

		description:
			"## The Second Conditional in English\n\n### What is the Second Conditional?\n\nThe second conditional is used to talk about hypothetical or imaginary situations in the present or future. It often describes scenarios that are unlikely or impossible to happen.\n\n### Structure of the Second Conditional\n\nThe structure of the second conditional is as follows:\n\n- **If clause**: if + subject + past simple verb\n- **Main clause**: subject + would + base verb\n\n### Examples:\n\n- If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.\n- If she knew his number, she would call him.\n- If they studied more, they would pass the exam.\n\n### How to Use the Second Conditional\n\nYou use the second conditional to express hypothetical situations that are not real or are unlikely to happen. This can be used for:\n\n- Imagining a different present or future: If I were a bird, I would fly all over the world. (I'm not a bird, and it's impossible in the present.)\n- Giving advice: If I were you, I would talk to him about it. (I'm not you, but this is my advice.)\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Use \"were\" for all subjects: In the if clause, it's standard to use \"were\" instead of \"was\" for all subjects, especially in formal English. For example: If he were taller, he would play basketball better.\n- Wouldn't: The negative form of would is wouldn't. For example: If I had free time, I wouldn't watch so much TV.\n- Could/Might: You can also use could or might instead of would in the main clause. For example: If I had more money, I could travel the world. (This means I would be able to travel.)\n\n### Practice:\n\nTry creating your own sentences using the second conditional. For example:\n\n- If I lived in New York, I would visit Central Park every day.\n- If he won the lottery, he might buy a new car.\n- If I lived in Australia, I could have better opportunities and of course great life.",

		description:
			'## Objects in a Sentence\n\n### What is an Object in a Sentence?\n\nAn object in a sentence is a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun that receives the action of a verb. Objects give more information about the verb and are essential for understanding the full meaning of the sentence.\n\n### Types of Objects\n\n- **Direct Object**: Directly receives the action of the verb.\n  - Example: She reads a book. (The book is the direct object receiving the action of reading.)\n- **Indirect Object**: Receives the direct object.\n  - Example: He gave her a gift. (Her is the indirect object receiving the gift, which is the direct object.)\n\n### Identifying Objects in Sentences\n\nTo identify objects, look for the nouns or pronouns that are affected by the verb. Here are some steps:\n\n- Find the verb: Determine the action in the sentence.\n- Ask "what?" or "whom?" after the verb to find the direct object.\n- Ask "to whom?" or "for whom?" after the direct object to find the indirect object.\n\nExample:\n\n- Sentence: She writes a letter to her friend.\n  - Verb: writes\n  - Direct Object: a letter (What does she write? A letter.)\n  - Indirect Object: her friend (To whom does she write a letter? Her friend.)\n\n### Changing Sentence Structure\n\nYou can change the structure of a sentence by rearranging the objects while keeping the same context.\n\nExample:\n\n- Original Sentence: He gave Maria a book.\n  - Verb: gave\n  - Direct Object: a book (What did he give? A book.)\n  - Indirect Object: Maria (To whom did he give a book? Maria.)\n- Rephrased Sentence: He gave a book to Maria.\nThe context remains the same, but the sentence structure is different.\n\n### Passive Voice\n\nOne way to change the structure while maintaining the context is by using the passive voice.\n\nExample:\n\n- Active Voice: The teacher explained the lesson to the students.\n- Passive Voice: The lesson was explained to the students by the teacher.\nIn the passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.\n\n### Practice\n\nTry identifying the objects and changing the sentence structure:\n\n- Original: She sent him an email.\n  - Direct Object: an email\n  - Indirect Object: him\n- Rephrased: She sent an email to him.\n- Original: He gave me money.\n  - What did he give? Money\n  - To whom did he give the money? Me.',

			'## History and Usage of ‘Till’ and ‘Until’\n\n### History of "Till" and "Until"\n\n- **Till**: The word "till" is actually the older of the two, dating back to Old English. It has been in use since around the 9th century and comes from the Old Norse word "til," which means "to."\n\n- **Until**: "Until" came into use later, around the 12th century. It is a combination of "un-" (a prefix meaning "up to" or "as far as") and "till."\n\n### Differences Between "Till" and "Until"\n\n- **Meaning**: Both "till" and "until" mean the same thing: up to the point in time or the occurrence of an event. There is no difference in their meanings.\n\n- **Formality**: "Until" is considered slightly more formal than "till." In written English, "until" is more commonly used, while "till" is more frequently found in spoken English.\n\n- **Usage in Negative Sentences**: In negative sentences, both can be used interchangeably, but "until" is more commonly preferred.\n\n### How to Use "Till" and "Until"\n\n- **To indicate time**:\n  - Example: "She waited until midnight."\n  - Example: "She waited till midnight."\n\n- **In conditional sentences**:\n  - Example: "You can\'t leave until the meeting is over."\n  - Example: "You can\'t leave till the meeting is over."\n\n- **In negative sentences**:\n  - Example: "He didn\'t come home until the next morning."\n  - Example: "He didn\'t come home till the next morning."\n\n### Where to Use "Till" and "Until"\n\n- Use "until" in more formal writing contexts, such as academic papers, business emails, or official documents.\n\n- Use "till" in informal writing or when you want to keep the tone casual and conversational.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- Both words are correct and interchangeable.\n- "Until" is slightly more formal.\n- "Till" is not an abbreviation of "until"; it\'s a word in its own right.',

			'## Infinitive Verbs\n\nAn infinitive verb is the base form of a verb, usually preceded by the word "to."\n\n- **Examples**: to run, to eat, to sleep.\n\nInfinitives can be used as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.\n\n- *Example*: She likes to run in the morning. (Here, "to run" functions as a noun, the object of the verb "likes.")\n\n### Gerunds\n\nA gerund is a verb form that ends in -ing and functions as a noun.\n\n- **Examples**: running, eating, sleeping.\n\nGerunds can be used in various parts of a sentence, such as the subject, object, or complement.\n\n- *Example*: Running is fun. (Here, "running" is the subject of the sentence.)\n\n### When to Use Gerunds:\n\n1. **As the Subject of a Sentence**:\n   - *Example*: Swimming is my favorite hobby.\n2. **As the Object of a Sentence**:\n   - *Example*: She enjoys dancing.\n3. **After Prepositions**:\n   - *Example*: He is good at painting.\n4. **After Certain Verbs**: Some verbs are followed by gerunds.\n   - **Examples**: enjoy, avoid, consider, suggest.\n   - *Example*: I enjoy reading books.\n\n### Actions at That Moment:\n\nWhen gerunds are used to describe an action happening at that moment, they function as the subject or object.\n\n- *Example*: Listening to music relaxes me. (This implies that listening to music, in general, is relaxing.)\n\n### Past Events or Actions:\n\nGerunds can sometimes refer to past actions, but it depends on the context.\n\n- *Example*: I remember meeting her last year. ("Meeting" is a gerund referring to a specific past event.)\n\nHere, the gerund "meeting" is used to indicate a past event, while "remember" is the main verb in the sentence.\n\n### Difference Between Gerund and Present Participle:\n\n- **Gerunds**: Function as nouns.\n   - *Example*: Jogging is fun. ("Jogging" is a gerund, acting as the subject.)\n- **Present Participles**: Used in continuous verb tenses and act as adjectives.\n   - *Example*: She is jogging in the park. ("Jogging" is a present participle, part of the verb phrase "is jogging.")\n\n### Summary Table:\n\n| Function | Example |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subject | Swimming is enjoyable. |\n| Object | She enjoys dancing. |\n| After Prepositions | He is good at painting. |\n| After Certain Verbs | I avoid eating junk food. |\n| Action (Current) | Listening to music is relaxing. |\n| Past Event/Action | I remember meeting her last year. |',

			"## Inseparable Phrasal Verbs\n\nPhrasal verbs are a common feature of English grammar, where a verb is combined with a preposition or adverb to create a new meaning. Some phrasal verbs are inseparable, meaning the verb and the particle (the preposition or adverb) must remain together and cannot be separated. Here are some examples and explanations:\n\n### Examples of Inseparable Phrasal Verbs\n\n- **Look after**:\n  - *Meaning*: To take care of someone or something.\n  - *Example*: I will look after your cat while you are on vacation.\n- **Put off**:\n  - *Meaning*: To delay or postpone something.\n  - *Example*: The meeting has been put off until next week.\n- **Take after**:\n  - *Meaning*: To resemble someone.\n  - *Example*: She takes after her mother in her love for cooking.\n- **Put up with**:\n  - *Meaning*: To tolerate or endure something unpleasant.\n  - *Example*: I can't put up with his constant complaining.\n- **Look forward to**:\n  - *Meaning*: To anticipate something with pleasure.\n  - *Example*: I look forward to seeing you at the party.\n- **Put on**:\n  - *Meaning*: To wear clothing.\n  - *Example*: She put on her favorite dress for the event.\n- **Take off**:\n  - *Meaning*: To remove clothing.\n  - *Example*: He took off his jacket and sat down.\n- **Put out**:\n  - *Meaning*: To extinguish a fire or light.\n  - *Example*: The firefighters put out the small fire in the kitchen.\n- **Put down**:\n  - *Meaning*: To write something.\n  - *Example*: She put down her thoughts in a journal.\n- **Put up**:\n  - *Meaning*: To build or construct something.\n  - *Example*: They put up a new fence around the garden.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n1. **Inseparable**: The verb and the particle must stay together. You cannot separate them with an object or other words.\n2. **Fixed Meaning**: The meaning of the phrasal verb is fixed and cannot be changed by adding or removing words.\n3. **Idiomatic**: Many phrasal verbs are idiomatic, meaning their meaning cannot be derived from the individual words.\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Context**: Pay attention to the context in which the phrasal verb is used. The meaning often depends on the situation.\n- **Examples**: Look for examples in sentences to understand how the phrasal verb is used.\n- **Memorization**: Practice common inseparable phrasal verbs through repetition and context.\n\nUnderstanding inseparable phrasal verbs can significantly enhance your English proficiency, as they are a fundamental part of the language.",

		description:
			"## Using 'Should' to Talk About Probability in the Near Future\n\n'Should' is a versatile modal verb used to express a high degree of certainty or expectation about something happening in the near future. It’s particularly useful for making predictions based on logical reasoning, facts, or past experience.\n\n### Structure\n\nThe basic structure is:\n\n- **Subject + should + base form of the verb**\n\n### Usage\n\n**'Should'** is used to express a strong likelihood or expectation about future events. It conveys confidence based on available information.\n\n### When to Use It\n\nUse 'should' when you believe something is likely to happen based on:\n- Logical reasoning\n- Facts\n- Past experience\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Weather Forecasts**:\n   - *It should rain later this afternoon.* (There is a high probability based on the weather forecast.)\n2. **Academic Predictions**:\n   - *She should ace the test tomorrow.* (Given her study habits and past performance, it’s very likely.)\n3. **Travel Plans**:\n   - *The flight should arrive at 8 PM.* (According to the schedule, this is the expected time.)\n4. **Health**:\n   - *You should feel better by tomorrow if you take the medicine.* (Based on the doctor’s advice and the nature of the illness.)\n5. **Work**:\n   - *I should finish the project by the end of the day.* (Based on the current progress and the amount of work left.)\n\nBy using 'should,' you’re giving your listener a sense of expectation or strong likelihood about events in the near future.\n\n### Questions with 'Should'\n\nTo ask questions about probability or advice using 'should,' invert the subject and 'should':\n\n- **Structure**: Should + subject + base form of the verb\n\n**Examples**:\n\n1. *Should I bring an umbrella today?* (Is there a high probability of rain?)\n2. *Should we start the meeting now?* (Is it a good time to start the meeting?)\n3. *Should she call him back tomorrow?* (Is it likely she needs to call him back?)\n\n### Negative Statements with 'Should'\n\nTo form negative statements, add 'not' after 'should' (should not = shouldn’t):\n\n- **Structure**: Subject + should not/shouldn’t + base form of the verb\n\n**Examples**:\n\n1. *You shouldn’t eat too much sugar.* (It's advisable not to eat too much sugar.)\n2. *They shouldn’t arrive late.* (There’s a low probability of them arriving late.)\n3. *He shouldn’t have any problems with the exam.* (It’s unlikely he will have problems with the exam.)\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n1. **High Probability**: 'Should' expresses a strong likelihood or expectation.\n2. **Flexibility**: It can be used in statements, questions, and negative sentences.\n3. **Context Matters**: The meaning of 'should' depends on the context, whether it’s a prediction, advice, or expectation.\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Create Sentences**: Practice forming sentences using 'should' to express probability, advice, or expectations.\n- **Use Real-Life Scenarios**: Apply 'should' in everyday situations, such as making plans or giving advice.\n- **Listen and Observe**: Pay attention to how native speakers use 'should' in conversations, movies, or podcasts.\n\nUsing 'should' effectively helps you communicate predictions, expectations, and advice with clarity and confidence.",

			"## Understanding and Using Question Tags\n\nQuestion tags are short questions added at the end of statements to confirm information, seek agreement, or keep a conversation interactive. They are more common in spoken English than in writing and are often used when the speaker expects the listener to agree.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n1. **Intonation**:\n   - **Falling intonation**: Used when the speaker is almost sure of the answer.\n     - *Example*: You’re coming to the party with us, aren’t you? (falling intonation)\n   - **Rising intonation**: Used when the speaker is less sure or seeking confirmation.\n     - *Example*: She’ll join the team, won’t she? (rising intonation)\n\n2. **How to Create Question Tags**:\n   - **If there’s an auxiliary verb**: Use the same auxiliary verb in the tag.\n     - *Example*: You **have** traveled to Tokyo, **haven’t** you?\n   - **If there’s no auxiliary verb**: Use the appropriate form of 'do' (do, does, did).\n     - *Example*: You like broccoli, **don’t** you?\n     - *Example*: She studies English, **doesn’t** she?\n     - *Example*: You went to the party, **didn’t** you?\n\n3. **Verb 'to be'**:\n   - Use the same form of 'to be' in the tag, except with 'I am,' where 'aren’t I?' is used.\n     - *Example*: She’s American, **isn’t** she?\n     - *Example*: I am next, **aren’t** I?\n\n4. **Modal Verbs**:\n   - If the sentence contains a modal verb (can, will, should, etc.), use the same modal in the tag.\n     - *Example*: You can drive, **can’t** you?\n\n### Examples for Clarity\n\n1. **With Auxiliary Verbs**:\n   - *He has finished the report, **hasn’t** he?*\n   - *We are meeting at 5 PM, **aren’t** we?*\n2. **Without Auxiliary Verbs**:\n   - *They play soccer every weekend, **don’t** they?*\n   - *She loves coffee, **doesn’t** she?*\n3. **With 'to be'**:\n   - *It is a beautiful day, **isn’t** it?*\n   - *I am your teacher, **aren’t** I?*\n\n### Additional Points\n\n1. **General Usage**:\n   - Question tags are often used for confirmation or to keep a conversation going. They make the conversation more interactive and engaging.\n2. **Exceptions with 'I am'**:\n   - As mentioned, with 'I am,' we use 'aren’t I?' instead of 'amn’t I?,' which is grammatically incorrect.\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Listen for Intonation**: Pay attention to how native speakers use intonation with question tags in conversations or media.\n- **Create Your Own Tags**: Practice forming question tags for different types of sentences (with and without auxiliary verbs, with 'to be,' and with modal verbs).\n- **Use in Conversations**: Incorporate question tags into your daily conversations to make them more natural and engaging.\n\nMastering question tags helps you communicate more effectively and confidently in English, especially in spoken interactions.",

			'## Compound Adjectives\n\nCompound adjectives are formed when two or more words are combined to create an adjective that describes a noun. They often provide more specific information about the noun they modify. Here are the main patterns, examples, and rules for using compound adjectives effectively.\n\n### Patterns of Compound Adjectives\n\n1. **Adjective + Noun**:\n   - *Example*: *A **high-tech** gadget.*\n   - *Example*: *A **full-time** job.*\n\n2. **Noun + Adjective**:\n   - *Example*: *A **chocolate-covered** raisin.*\n   - *Example*: *A **New York-based** company.*\n\n3. **Noun + Past Participle**:\n   - *Example*: *A **well-known** author.*\n   - *Example*: *A **two-year-old** child.*\n\n4. **Number + Singular Noun**:\n   - *Example*: *A **five-star** hotel.*\n   - *Example*: *A **ten-page** report.*\n\n5. **Adjective + Past Participle**:\n   - *Example*: *A **well-preserved** artifact.*\n   - *Example*: *A **highly-regarded** professor.*\n\n### Additional Patterns and Examples\n\n1. **Verb + Noun**:\n   - *Example*: *A **break-in** alarm.*\n   - *Example*: *A **take-off** procedure.*\n\n2. **Verb + Past Participle**:\n   - *Example*: *A **no-go** zone.*\n   - *Example*: *A **pick-up** truck.*\n\n3. **Adverb + Adjective**:\n   - *Example*: *A **well-known** fact.*\n   - *Example*: *A **high-minded** individual.*\n\n4. **Adverb + Past Participle**:\n   - *Example*: *A **well-traveled** person.*\n   - *Example*: *A **quick-thinking** decision.*\n\n### Using Hyphens\n\nCompound adjectives are often hyphenated when they come before the noun they modify. This helps to clarify the meaning and avoid confusion. For example:\n\n- **High-tech** gadget (not high tech gadget)\n- **New York-based** company (not New York based company)\n\n### When Not to Hyphenate\n\n- **After the Noun**: When the compound adjective comes after the noun, it is usually not hyphenated.\n  - *Example*: *The gadget is high tech.* (not high-tech gadget)\n  - *Example*: *The house is three bedroom.* (not three-bedroom house)\n\n### Exceptions and Special Cases\n\n- **Common Usage**: Some compound adjectives become so common that they are no longer hyphenated.\n  - *Example*: *He is a high school teacher.* (not high-school teacher)\n  - *Example*: *She has a part time job.* (not part-time job)\n\n### Examples of Compound Adjectives\n\n1. **Adjective + Noun**:\n   - *She bought a **low-budget** laptop.*\n   - *They live in a **three-bedroom** house.*\n\n2. **Noun + Adjective**:\n   - *He enjoys **chocolate-covered** pretzels.*\n   - *She works for a **London-based** firm.*\n\n3. **Noun + Past Participle**:\n   - *He is a **well-known** actor.*\n   - *The **three-year-old** boy loves to play.*\n\n4. **Number + Singular Noun**:\n   - *They stayed at a **five-star** hotel.*\n   - *She wrote a **ten-page** essay.*\n\n5. **Adjective + Past Participle**:\n   - *The museum has a **well-preserved** collection.*\n   - *He is a **highly-regarded** scientist.*\n\n### Tips for Using Compound Adjectives\n\n- **Consistency**: Be consistent with hyphenation in your writing.\n- **Check a Dictionary**: If unsure, check a dictionary to see if the compound adjective is hyphenated.\n- **Context Matters**: Sometimes the meaning can change based on whether the words are hyphenated or not.\n\nMastering compound adjectives helps you provide more precise and descriptive language in English.',

		description:
			'## Forming Verbs from Adjectives and Nouns\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Dictionary:\n\n***“A suffix is a letter or group of letters added at the end of a word which makes a new word.”***\n\nUnlike prefixes, which usually do not change the class of the base word, suffixes often change the class of the word (e.g., from noun to verb). In this class, you will learn how to form **verbs** by adding suffixes to **nouns** and **adjectives**.\n\n### Common Suffixes for Forming Verbs\n\n| **SUFFIX** | **MEANING** | **EXAMPLES** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***-en*** | to become | awaken, darken, widen, shorten, strengthen, soften |\n| ***-ise/-ize*** | to make or become | sympathise, empathise, symbolize, characterize |\n| ***-ate*** | to become | activate, liquidate, collaborate, create, fabricate |\n| ***-ify, -fy*** | to make or become | justify, purify, amplify, satisfy, specify, classify |\n\n- **Note**: Both *-ise* and *-ize* are correct. *-ise* is more common in British English, while *-ize* is more common in American English.\n\n### Examples in Sentences\n\n1. **-en**:\n   - *The sky began to **darken** as the storm approached.*\n   - *She tried to **soften** her tone to avoid sounding harsh.*\n\n2. **-ise/-ize**:\n   - *The artist wanted to **symbolize** hope in her painting.*\n   - *He tried to **empathise** with her situation.*\n\n3. **-ate**:\n   - *The scientist worked to **activate** the new device.*\n   - *They decided to **collaborate** on the project.*\n\n4. **-ify/-fy**:\n   - *The teacher asked the students to **justify** their answers.*\n   - *The filter is used to **purify** the water.*\n\n### Practice Activity\n\nChoose five words from the list above and write sentences using them in the comments section. For example:\n\n1. *The government plans to **widen** the road to reduce traffic.*\n2. *She hopes to **strengthen** her relationship with her colleagues.*\n3. *The company aims to **modernize** its facilities next year.*\n4. *He tried to **simplify** the instructions for better understanding.*\n5. *The chef wanted to **intensify** the flavor of the dish.*\n\n### Tips for Using Suffixes\n\n- **Understand the Meaning**: Each suffix has a specific meaning, so choose the one that best fits the context.\n- **Check Spelling**: Be mindful of the spelling differences between British and American English (e.g., *-ise* vs. *-ize*).\n- **Practice Regularly**: Forming verbs from nouns and adjectives is a skill that improves with practice.\n\nMastering these suffixes helps you expand your vocabulary and express ideas more precisely in English.',

			"## Relative Clauses\n\nRelative clauses provide additional information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. They usually start with a relative pronoun like **who**, **whom**, **which**, **that**, or **what**. Here’s a detailed guide to understanding and using relative clauses effectively.\n\n### Types of Relative Clauses\n\n1. **Essential (Restrictive) Relative Clauses**:\n   - Provide essential information about the noun they modify.\n   - **Examples**:\n     - *The book **that** I borrowed from the library is fascinating.*\n     - *The student **who** answered the question correctly received a prize.*\n\n2. **Non-Essential (Non-Restrictive) Relative Clauses**:\n   - Provide extra information that is not crucial to the meaning of the sentence. They are usually set off by commas.\n   - **Examples**:\n     - *My friend, **who** is a talented musician, will perform tonight.*\n     - *The car, **which** was parked outside, belongs to my neighbor.*\n\n### Using 'What' in Relative Clauses\n\nRelative clauses can also be formed using the word **'what'**, though this is less common.\n\n1. **Essential Relative Clause**:\n   - *The book **what** I borrowed from the library is fascinating.*\n     - Here, *'what I borrowed from the library'* is essential to know which book is being referred to.\n\n2. **Non-Essential Relative Clause**:\n   - *The movie, **what** we watched last night, was amazing.*\n     - Here, *'what we watched last night'* is additional information about the movie, but it's not essential to know which movie is being referred to.\n\n### Tips for Using Relative Clauses\n\n- **Punctuation**: Use commas to separate non-essential clauses.\n- **Clarity**: Ensure the relative clause clearly refers to the correct noun or pronoun.\n- **Verb Agreement**: Make sure the verb in the relative clause agrees with the noun or pronoun it modifies.\n\n### Examples for Practice\n\n1. **Essential Clauses**:\n   - *The person **who** called you is waiting outside.*\n   - *The laptop **that** I bought last week is already broken.*\n\n2. **Non-Essential Clauses**:\n   - *My brother, **who** lives in New York, is visiting next week.*\n   - *The painting, **which** was created in the 19th century, is worth millions.*\n\n3. **Using 'What'**:\n   - *The idea **what** you proposed sounds interesting.*\n   - *The cake, **what** she baked for the party, was delicious.*\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Identify Clauses**: Practice identifying essential and non-essential clauses in sentences.\n- **Create Sentences**: Write your own sentences using relative clauses to describe people, places, or things.\n- **Check Punctuation**: Pay attention to the use of commas in non-essential clauses.\n\nMastering relative clauses helps you add detail and clarity to your sentences in English.",

			"## Understanding Relative Clauses\n\nRelative clauses are used to join sentences or provide additional information about a noun. They can be defining (essential) or non-defining (non-essential). Here’s a detailed guide to using relative clauses effectively.\n\n### Uses of Relative Clauses\n\n1. **To Join Two Sentences**:\n   - *Example*: I bought a car. The car drives itself.\n   - *Combined*: I bought a car **that drives itself**.\n\n2. **To Give Extra Information**:\n   - *Example*: My boss, **who lives in Seattle**, is very nice.\n\n### Relative Pronouns\n\nRelative pronouns are used to introduce relative clauses. Here’s how they are used:\n\n1. **For People**:\n   - **Subject**: *who*\n     - *Example*: The woman **who called you** is my sister.\n   - **Object**: *who/whom*\n     - *Example*: The man **who/whom I met** is a doctor.\n   - **Possessive**: *whose*\n     - *Example*: The student **whose book was lost** is in my class.\n\n2. **For Things**:\n   - **Subject/Object**: *which*\n     - *Example*: The book **which is on the table** is mine.\n   - **Possessive**: *whose*\n     - *Example*: The house **whose roof is red** belongs to my friend.\n\n3. **For Places**:\n   - **Subject/Object**: *where*\n     - *Example*: This is the park **where we met**.\n\n### Defining Relative Clauses\n\n- Begin with relative pronouns (who, which, that).\n- Provide essential information about the noun.\n- No commas are used.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- The man **who was looking for you** has just gone.\n- The car **that was blocking the way** is no longer there.\n\n### Non-Defining Relative Clauses\n\n- Begin with relative pronouns (who, which, whose).\n- Add extra, non-essential information.\n- Commas are used to separate the clause from the rest of the sentence.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- John’s mother, **who lives in Colombia**, has three children.\n- My friend John, **who also works as a teacher**, is traveling to New York.\n- Yesterday I met a man named Andres, **whose wife works in New York**.\n\n### Embedded Defining Clauses\n\n- Begin with relative pronouns (who, which, that).\n- Go in the middle of the sentence.\n- Define or identify the noun.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- The man **who was looking for you** has just gone.\n- The car, **which was blocking the way**, is no longer there.\n\n*Note*: You can also add other types of clauses, such as *'despite the rain'*, to provide additional context.\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Combine Sentences**: Practice joining two sentences using relative clauses.\n- **Identify Clauses**: Determine if a clause is defining or non-defining and use commas accordingly.\n- **Use Relative Pronouns**: Choose the correct relative pronoun based on the noun (person, thing, place) and its function (subject, object, possessive).\n\nMastering relative clauses helps you add detail and clarity to your sentences in English.",

			"## Expressing Cause and Effect\n\nCause and effect relationships explain why something happens and what results from it. Here are some common structures to express these relationships in English.\n\n### 1. Using **'so...that'**\n\n- **Structure**: *so* + adjective/adverb + *that* + clause (result)\n- **Example**: The movie was **so** interesting **that** I watched it twice.\n- **Explanation**: The adjective or adverb describes the intensity or degree of something, leading to a specific result.\n\n### 2. Using **'such...that'**\n\n- **Structure**: *such* + adjective + noun + *that* + clause (result)\n- **Example**: It was **such** a beautiful day **that** we decided to go to the beach.\n- **Explanation**: *Such* emphasizes the quality of the noun, resulting in a particular outcome.\n\n### 3. Using **'because'**\n\n- **Structure**: *because* + clause (reason) + clause (result)\n- **Example**: **Because** it was raining, we stayed indoors.\n- **Explanation**: *Because* introduces the reason, followed by the result.\n\n### 4. Using **'as a result'**\n\n- **Structure**: Clause (reason) + *as a result* + clause (result)\n- **Example**: She worked hard; **as a result**, she passed the exam.\n- **Explanation**: This structure shows the consequence of the preceding clause.\n\n### 5. Using **'due to'**\n\n- **Structure**: *due to* + noun/gerund (reason) + clause (result)\n- **Example**: **Due to** the traffic, we arrived late.\n- **Explanation**: *Due to* indicates the reason for the result stated in the main clause.\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Create Sentences**: Practice writing sentences using each structure to express cause and effect.\n- **Identify Relationships**: Look for cause-and-effect relationships in texts or conversations and identify the structures used.\n- **Combine Structures**: Try combining different structures in a single paragraph to improve your fluency.\n\nMastering these structures helps you explain relationships between events clearly and effectively in English.",

			'## Understanding Adverbs of Comment and Manner\n\nAdverbs of comment and manner are used to express opinions, attitudes, or describe how actions are performed. Here’s a detailed guide to their usage and positioning in sentences.\n\n### Adverbs of Comment\n\nAdverbs of comment express the speaker\'s opinion or attitude about what is being said. They often answer questions like *\'How?\'* or *\'What?\'* about the action.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n- *Well*: "She sings **well**."\n- *Badly*: "He plays the piano **badly**."\n- *Quickly*: "The car drives **quickly**."\n- *Slowly*: "The tortoise moves **slowly**."\n\n#### Positioning:\n\nAdverbs of comment typically come **after the main verb** or the **auxiliary verb** (if there is one).\n\n- *She sings **well**.*\n- *He plays the piano **badly**.*\n- *The car drives **quickly**.*\n- *The tortoise moves **slowly**.*\n\n### Adverbs of Manner\n\nAdverbs of manner describe how an action is performed.

			"## Using 'Need to' to Express Importance\n\nIn English, we use **'need to'** to say that something is important for someone to do. This form is often used for one-time actions rather than ongoing responsibilities or duties. Here’s a detailed guide to its usage, along with alternative structures for formal contexts.\n\n### Basic Usage of 'Need to'\n\n- **Affirmative**:\n  - *She **needs to** come to the meeting next week.*\n  - *I **need to** make sure this apartment is clean before the guests arrive.*\n\n- **Negative**:\n  - *You **don’t need to** come to the meeting next week.*\n  - *I **don’t need to** clean the apartment now since we’re all going to a restaurant.*\n\n### Alternative Formal Structures\n\nTo express the same idea in a more formal way, you can use the structure **'It’s necessary to'**.\n\n- **Affirmative**:\n  - *It’s **necessary to** come to the meeting next week.*\n\n- **Negative**:\n  - *It’s **not necessary to** come to the meeting next week.*\n\n- **Interrogative**:\n  - *Is it **necessary to** come to the meeting next week?*\n\n### Emphasizing the Subject\n\nIf you want to emphasize that someone is needed to do something, you can include **'for + object'** after **'necessary'**.\n\n- **Affirmative**:\n  - *It’s necessary **for Sarah** to come to the meeting next week.*\n\n- **Negative**:\n  - *It’s not necessary **for Sarah** to come to the meeting next week.*\n\n- **Interrogative**:\n  - *Is it necessary **for Sarah** to come to the meeting next week?*\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Verb Form**: The verb after **'need to'** or **'necessary to'** always remains in its infinitive form (e.g., *'to come'*, not *'to comes'*).\n- **Formality**: **'Need to'** is more common in everyday speech, while **'It’s necessary to'** is more formal.\n- **Emphasis**: Use **'for + object'** to specify who is needed to perform the action.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Using 'Need to'**:\n   - *She **needs to** finish the report by tomorrow.*\n   - *We **don’t need to** bring anything to the party.*\n\n2. **Using 'It’s necessary to'**:\n   - *It’s **necessary to** submit the application by Friday.*\n   - *It’s **not necessary to** wear formal attire to the event.*\n\n3. **Emphasizing the Subject**:\n   - *It’s necessary **for John** to attend the meeting.*\n   - *Is it necessary **for us** to arrive early?*\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Create Sentences**: Practice writing sentences using both **'need to'** and **'It’s necessary to'**.\n- **Identify Context**: Determine when to use informal vs. formal structures based on the situation.\n- **Listen and Observe**: Pay attention to how native speakers use these structures in conversations, movies, or books.\n\nMastering **'need to'** and its alternatives helps you express importance and necessity clearly and effectively in English.",

Here’s a detailed guide to its usage, along with examples and alternative structures.\n\n### Rules for Using \'s in Time Expressions\n\n1. **Singular Time Periods**: If the period of time is singular, the apostrophe goes **before the s**.\n   - *Examples*:\n     - *One week’s notice.*\n     - *One month’s holiday.*\n     - *One year’s experience.*\n\n2. **Plural Time Periods**: If the period of time is plural, the apostrophe goes **after the s**.\n   - *Examples*:\n     - *Three weeks’ notice.*\n     - *Four months’ holiday.*\n     - *Five years’ experience.*\n\n### Alternative Structure with "of"\n\nYou can also replace the apostrophe with **"of"** to express the same idea.\n\n- *Examples*:\n  - *I have five years **of** experience.* (or *I have five years’ experience.*)\n  - *I had two months **of** vacation.* (or *I had two months’ vacation.*)\n  - *She only gave me two weeks **of** notice.* (or *She only gave me two weeks’ notice.*)\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Singular Time Periods**:\n   - *One day’s work is enough to finish the project.*\n   - *He took one hour’s break before continuing.*\n\n2. **Plural Time Periods**:\n   - *They gave me two weeks’ notice before the event.*\n   - *She has ten years’ experience in the field.*\n\n3. **Using "of"**:\n   - *I need one week **of** preparation for the exam.*\n   - *He has three months **of** training ahead.*\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Identify Singular vs. Plural**: Determine if the time period is singular or plural to decide where to place the apostrophe.\n- **Use "of" as an Alternative**: Practice rewriting sentences using **"of"** instead of the apostrophe.\n- **Create Sentences**: Write your own sentences using both structures to reinforce your understanding.\n\nMastering the use of \'s in time expressions helps you communicate durations and possessions clearly and accurately in English.',

			"## Using 'Do', 'Does', and 'Did' as Placeholders\n\nThe words **'do'**, **'does'**, and **'did'** can be used as placeholders to avoid repeating the same part of a sentence. This helps make your language more concise and less redundant. Here’s a detailed guide to their usage, along with examples.\n\n### **Do / Does**\n\nThese are used to avoid repeating verbs or actions in the present tense.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n1. **First Person Pronoun**:\n   - Instead of: *She doesn’t think I like her, but **I like her**.*\n   - Simplified: *She doesn’t think I like her, but **I do**.*\n\n2. **Third Person Pronoun**:\n   - Instead of: *He thinks she doesn’t exercise, but she **exercises**.*\n   - Simplified: *He thinks she doesn’t exercise, but she **does**.*\n\n### **Did**\n\nThis is used to avoid repeating verbs or actions in the past tense.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n- Instead of: *She asked me to buy it, so **I bought** it.*\n- Simplified: *She asked me to buy it, so I **did**.*\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Present Tense**: Use **'do'** or **'does'** to replace verbs in the present tense.\n- **Past Tense**: Use **'did'** to replace verbs in the past tense.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: These placeholders help make your sentences more concise and natural.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Using 'Do'**:\n   - *He thinks I don’t know the answer, but **I do**.*\n   - *They believe we don’t care, but **we do**.*\n\n2. **Using 'Does'**:\n   - *She thinks he doesn’t work hard, but **he does**.*\n   - *They assume she doesn’t understand, but **she does**.*\n\n3. **Using 'Did'**:\n   - *He thought I didn’t finish the report, but **I did**.*\n   - *She asked if I called the client, and **I did**.*\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Identify Redundancy**: Look for opportunities to replace repeated verbs with **'do'**, **'does'**, or **'did'**.\n- **Create Sentences**: Practice writing sentences using these placeholders to simplify your language.\n- **Listen and Observe**: Pay attention to how native speakers use these placeholders in conversations, movies, or books.\n\nMastering the use of **'do'**, **'does'**, and **'did'** as placeholders helps you communicate more effectively and naturally in English.",

			'## Understanding Phrasal-Prepositional Verbs\n\nPhrasal-prepositional verbs are made up of three parts: a **verb**, a **particle**, and a **preposition**. They are commonly used in informal contexts, and their meanings are often difficult to guess from their individual parts. Here’s a detailed guide to their usage, along with examples.\n\n### Common Phrasal-Prepositional Verbs\n\n1. **Stand up for**:\n   - *Meaning*: To defend or support a particular idea or person.\n   - *Example*: *Stand up for yourself!*\n\n2. **Look up to**:\n   - *Meaning*: To admire or respect someone.\n   - *Example*: *I have always looked up to my mother.*\n\n3. **Get on with**:\n   - *Meaning*: To have a good relationship with someone.\n   - *Example*: *Do you get on with your co-workers?*\n\n4. **Look forward to**:\n   - *Meaning*: To be pleased or excited for something to happen.\n   - *Example*: *We look forward to meeting you next week.*\n\n5. **Put up with**:\n   - *Meaning*: To accept an unpleasant situation or person.\n   - *Example*: *He’s so moody. I don’t know why she puts up with him.*\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Structure**: Phrasal-prepositional verbs consist of a verb, a particle, and a preposition.\n- **Informal Contexts**: These verbs are often used in informal or conversational English.\n- **Idiomatic Meaning**: Their meanings are not always obvious from the individual words, so they need to be learned as whole expressions.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. **Stand up for**:\n   - *You need to stand up for your rights.*\n   - *She always stands up for her friends.*\n\n2. **Look up to**:\n   - *Many students look up to their teachers.*\n   - *He looks up to his older brother.*\n\n3. **Get on with**:\n   - *I get on with my neighbors very well.*\n   - *Do you get on with your boss?*\n\n4. **Look forward to**:\n   - *I’m looking forward to the weekend.*\n   - *They are looking forward to the trip.*\n\n5. **Put up with**:\n   - *I can’t put up with this noise anymore.*\n   - *She puts up with his bad temper.*\n\n### Practice Tips\n\n- **Learn as Whole Expressions**: Memorize phrasal-prepositional verbs as complete phrases rather than individual words.\n- **Use in Context**: Practice using these verbs in sentences to understand their meanings and nuances.\n- **Listen and Observe**: Pay attention to how native speakers use these verbs in conversations, movies, or books.\n\nMastering phrasal-prepositional verbs helps you communicate more naturally and effectively in informal English.',
